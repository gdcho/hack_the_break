## Project Description
Our app offers a self-assessment tool, the Glance Imposter Phenomenon Syndrome Self-Assessment Tool, which helps users identify the symptoms and triggers of Imposter Syndrome. By taking the assessment, users can gain a better understanding of their own thought patterns and behaviours related to Imposter Syndrome, and can then take steps to address it.
