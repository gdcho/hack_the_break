## What it does
Our app offers a self-assessment tool, the Glance Imposter Phenomenon Syndrome Self-Assessment Tool, which helps users identify the symptoms and triggers of Imposter Syndrome. By taking the assessment, users can gain a better understanding of their own thought patterns and behaviours related to Imposter Syndrome, and can then take steps to address it. 

## How we built it
The frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, were utilized to create the user interface and interactivity of the app. Firebase served as the backend infrastructure for storing and managing user data and authentication, as well as providing real-time updates and hosting. JSON was used to exchange data between the frontend and backend, facilitating seamless communication between the two.
